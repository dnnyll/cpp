About pointers and references

We use a pointer when one of these is true:

The object might not exist yet
(HumanB starts without a weapon)

The object might change later
(a pointer can be reassigned)

The object might be optional
(null means “nothing”)

It’s not really about not knowing the value — it’s about uncertainty of existence or ownership.

4. The simplest way to think about it

A good mental model:

Reference → “This object must exist and will not change”

Pointer → “This object may exist, may change, or may be missing”

That’s the key nuance 42 wants you to grasp.
